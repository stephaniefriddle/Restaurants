The struggle of deciding where to eat is real, so I designed this project to keep an ongoing list of restaurants. The restaurants come from my personal experiences and recommendations. I've implemented checkboxes to highlight restaurants by whether or not I've been there, if it's one of my favorites, or if it's somewhere new I've heard about and really want to try. I want to be able to go to this list and easily find options for any occassion or event.

To accomplish this, I have a web server that's connected with ExpressJS. I use CRUD actions to manipulate the data.

You're currently reading the README, but below you will find the other requirements and features I've choosen to implement:

 - I used Bootstrap to create a responsive design with two media queries. The layout of the results change based on screen size on the main page. The form changes layout on the create page.

 - You'll see more than the required 5 commits.

 - Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app.  You will see this feature with the 'Ready? Let's do it.' button.

 - Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app. I use CRUD actions with fetch() for this.

 - Post to an external API and show that it has saved/persisted.
    - The create.html page includes the form and once the restaurant is saved, please head to the index.html page and load the restaurants. It should be the last result.
 
 - Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
    - The create.html page includes the form and once the restaurant is saved, please head to the index.html page and load the restaurants. It should be the last result. 
 
 - Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS.
