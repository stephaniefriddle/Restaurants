    <h1>Hello.</h1>
    <h2>Welcome.</h2>
    <h3>I'm glad you're here.</h3>
    <p>
        Do you ever have trouble deciding on which restaurant to eat at? Do you remember seeing somewhere you
        definetly want to go, but then forget all about it until right after you just ate somewhere else? Do you have
        a special celebration coming up and you want to choose somewhere that's perfect for it? Do you have trouble 
        deciding what you're in the mood for? Is eating out one of your hobbies?
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, my answer is yes to all of these.
    </p>
    <p>
        You're just moments away from getting a customized list where you can remember recommendations, prioritize where you
        want to go, and save your favorite restaurants for all of time.
