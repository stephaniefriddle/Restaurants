# Dev API

## Installation
Run `npm install --save @justinkprince/dev-api`.


## Starting the Dev API
In your project file, import the package and instantiate it with required configuration options. For each resource, it will create a POST, PUT, and DELETE routes, along with two GET routes: one for fetching all of the items in a collection and one for fetching a single item by ID.

See the [example](example/example-1.js) for more info.
